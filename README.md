# 8lobal
"8lobal," pronounced like "global," is a social media where people can share recommendations or important or memorable places of theirs, which we're doing using Google Maps APIs. We stylized 'global' with an 8 because:
1) We're CodeU team 8 :)
2) It makes infinity symbol when you turn the '8' sideways, since connections are ~ endless ~

# Motivation
We wanted to make an app where people can realize the diversity they have within their communities and share these unique experiences

# Tech stack
Apache Maven Java backend
Some React in the frontend
HTML
CSS and Bootstrap
