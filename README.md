# 8lobal
"8lobal," pronounced like "global," is a website where people can share recommended, important, or memorable places of theirs. In doing so, we hope that people can connect and learn more about each other's journeys. We stylized 'global' with an 8 because:
1) We're CodeU team 8 :)
2) It makes infinity symbol when you turn the '8' sideways, since connections are ~ endless ~

# Motivation
We wanted to make an app where people can realize the diversity they have within their communities and share these unique experiences
